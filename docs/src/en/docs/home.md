Based on the vector magnetic field data observed by Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager([HMI](http://hmi.stanford.edu)) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), we have built a [3D solar active region magnetic field dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02091-5) using the Nonlinear Force-Free Coronal Magnetic Field ([NLFFF](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11207-012-9966-z))Extrapolations.

The current total is over 200 TB, 73,000 3D magnetograms spanning the years 2010 to 2019, with a temporal resolution of 96 minutes and a spatial resolution consistent with the original [sharp cea magnetograms](http://jsoc.stanford.edu/doc/data/hmi/sharp/sharp.htm).
