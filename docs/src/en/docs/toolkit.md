## Toolkit and product usage

## Description

The toolkit is divided into two parts, dataset construction and product usage.


### Dataset building

+ The dataset builder is currently available in cpu version and can be found at [pynlfff github](https://github.com/deepsolar/pynlfff/tree/master/pynlfff)



### 3D magnetic field data product usage

+ The product usage is divided into two parts: basic usage and toolkit-based usage.

    + We have distilled the basic usage in the toolkit to help researchers who are not comfortable downloading the full toolkit and who wish to borrow ideas to implement it through other languages. 

    + The toolkit-based use we provide some slightly more advanced features, such as visualization, and more features will be added later.
